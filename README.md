# Portfolio-Project-U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Marc-Bouzas

This was my first real project without step by step instructions.

It was supposed to test my newly acquired skills in data literacy and python fundamentals in an open and unguided environment.

I would really appreciate any feedback on my code.

Please keep in mind that I am still very new to coding.

Thank you.
